# NEY-Maternity-Reporting
Repository for code used by the North East and Yorkshire analytics team for creating maternity reports which use funnel plots (via the FunnelPlotR package) to identify outliers. The Word Document provides an overview of how the different files link together.

If you would like to access the underlying data which feeds the report or the Databricks code which is used to create it please contact will.manners@nhs.net
